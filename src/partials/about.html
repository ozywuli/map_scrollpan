          <h2>Hannibal's invasion of Rome</h2>
          <p>Hannibal's crossing of the Alps in 218 BC was one of the major achievements of the Second Punic War, and one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare.</p>

          <p><a href="http://ancient.eu/hannibal/" target="_blank">Hannibal</a>, son of Hamilcar Barca, (248–183 or 182 BC), commonly known as Hannibal was a Carthaginian military commander and tactician who is popularly credited as one of the most talented commanders in history. His father Hamilcar Barca was the leading Carthaginian commander during the First <a href="http://ancient.eu/Punic/" target="_blank">Punic</a> <a href="http://ancient.eu/war/" target="_blank">War</a>. Hannibal lived during a period of tension in the <a href="http://ancient.eu/mediterranean/" target="_blank">Mediterranean</a>, when <a href="http://ancient.eu/Rome/" target="_blank">Rome</a> (then the <a href="http://ancient.eu/Roman_Republic/" target="_blank">Roman Republic</a>) established its supremacy over other great powers such as <a href="http://ancient.eu/carthage/" target="_blank">Carthage</a>, and the <a href="http://ancient.eu/Hellenistic/" target="_blank">Hellenistic</a> kingdoms of <a href="http://ancient.eu/macedon/" target="_blank">Macedon</a>, <a href="http://ancient.eu/syracuse/" target="_blank">Syracuse</a>, and the <a href="http://ancient.eu/Seleucid_Empire/" target="_blank">Seleucid empire</a>.</p>

          <p>One of Hannibal's most famous achievements was at the outbreak of the Second Punic War, when he marched an army, which included war elephants, from Iberia over the Pyrenees and the Alps into northern Italy. In his first few years in Italy, he won three dramatic victories Trebia, Trasimene and Cannae and made several Roman allies. Hannibal occupied much of Italy for 15 years, however a Roman counter-invasion of North Africa forced Hannibal to return to Carthage, where he was decisively defeated by Scipio Africanus at the Battle of Zama. Scipio studied Hannibal's tactics and brilliantly devised some of his own, and finally defeated Rome's nemesis at Zama having previously driven Hasdrubal, Hannibal's brother, out of Spain.</p>
